# Trace lines seen in the output of the Tarmac RTL module from
# Cortex-M0-AT510-r0p0-00rel0 (RTL development kit). This omits
# multiple fields of the instruction line between the encoding and the
# disassembly: you normally expect an instruction-set state and a CPU
# mode, e.g. "T svc_s", then a separating colon.
#
# To parse this line, the parser must be told in advance what
# instruction set state it should assume when one isn't specified.
